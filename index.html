        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>I enjoy going to EDM festivals. I've been to festivals such as EDC, Electric Forest, Lost Lands, Bass Canyon, and many more. I plan on going to festivals in Europe one day as well such as festivals like Tomorrowland. I also eventually want to learn the skills to produce EDM and perform it with live mixing/DJing.</p>
